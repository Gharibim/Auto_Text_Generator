# Auto_Text_Generator

Retrained the model using Flickr 30k image dataset which contains 158873 image caption.</br>
The model will generate short captions based on the trained ones.</br>
Edited the original library to redirect the output to a file (optional). Pass `return_as_list=True` to `generate` function to get the output as list (preferred).</br>

Examples:</br>
Two teenagers are sitting on a sidewalk .</br>
A man is sitting on a bench looking at a park .</br>
Two people are standing on a rock .</br>
Man in a suit is in a field .</br>
Two young man in black shirt and a worker shorts playing a soccer ball .</br>
Two children are walking in front of a statue .</br></br>
